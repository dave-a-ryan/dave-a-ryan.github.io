                        >Actualize</a
                      >) taught full stack web development, focusing on Ruby on
                      Rails for backend and Vue.js for frontend. Most of my
                      hobby projects are written using this stack. Ruby and its
                      support system is very friendly with Mac architecture, but
                      not so friendly with Windows. I learned how to use a
                      Macbook during my time at Actualize, since I had only
                      known Windows machines since I was a kid. After
                      graduation, I had to deal with some technical difficulties
                      getting set up on my own laptop, so I wrote this guide for
                      myself and shared it with other Actualize grads.

                      This is the "Secret Santa" website I built for my extended
                      family. Each year we had an issue where people had bought
                      the same gift for the same person, and there would be
                      returns. We also had to send our Christmas list to
                      everyone in the family individually. With these problems
                      in mind, I made a website to solve them. Everyone's list
                      is up on the site for everyone to view, so there's no
                      miscommunication. Then when you decide to make a purchase,
                      everyone (but the person you're buying for) will see that
                      someone bought that gift.

                      I have a very large digital collection of music, it's
                      another hobby of mine to listen to as much new music as I
                      can. I still have my favorites, but with all the albums
                      releasing (and life in general), it's hard to know what's
                      new. This lets you search for individual artists to find
                      all their major LP releases, and filter for a certain
                      year. You can also upload a <code>.csv</code> file of your
                      collection and it will show which albums you're missing.

                      This was my capstone project for my coding bootcamp. One
                      of my hobbies is playing the trading card game Magic: The
                      Gathering. Within "Magic", there are a large number of
                      ways to play. Depending on which way you play, you might
                      not be equipped to play against someone else who also
                      plays Magic but in a different "format". I built this site
                      as a demonstration of a social Facebook-style site for
                      users to display which formats they play, and find
                      like-minded players in their area. You can search by zip
                      code distance, add friends, send each other messages, and
                      customize your profile with your favorite card.

                      My Dad is a retired painter, and this is the site I built
                      for him. It's got some samples of his work and a way to

                      volunteered to sit down and have their portraits taken. In
                      a variety of mediums, his work was displayed at the
                      Palette and Chisel in Chicago, IL on Veteran's Day
