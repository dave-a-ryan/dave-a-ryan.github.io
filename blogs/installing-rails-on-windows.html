      <p>
        Maybe you're moving from a Mac to a PC and are used to Rails, or maybe
        you got stuck in the Rails installation guide and went down 100
        different stack-overflow rabbit holes (like me) and got nowhere. Well
        it's not impossible, we can do this!
      </p>
      <p>
        The first part of this guide is almost exactly the
        <a href="https://gorails.com/setup/windows/10" target="_blank"
          >Gorails Signup guide</a
        >. If you've already gone through that, and you are stuck on the
        Postgresql setup - you can
        <a href="#postgres">skip to that section.</a> This tutorial also heavily
        leans on the blog
        <a
          href="https://karansingh1559.medium.com/how-to-set-up-postgresql-on-ubuntu-for-wsl-fcbb777d165b"
          target="_blank"
          >How to set up postgreSQL on Ubuntu for WSL</a
        >
        by Karan Singh. This was the lifesaver that kept me from throwing my
        laptop out the window and paying Tim Cook for an overpriced machine.
        This blog also uses a solution on
        <a
          href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32439167/psql-could-not-connect-to-server-connection-refused-error-when-connecting-to"
          target="_blank"
          >this Stackoverflow</a
        >
        question. With these three sources combined, I was able to successfully
        install Rails on Windows and you can too!
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a few things you need right off the bat. Windows Store (ships
        with Windows), and an up-to-date Windows version (Build 19041 and
        higher, you can check your version by using WIN+R and entering winver)
      </p>
      <p>
        For convenience, let's grab
        <a
          href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701"
          target="_blank"
          >Windows Terminal</a
        >. This will allow you to have multiple tabs open at the same time, and
        works with Ubuntu so you can quickly move back and forth from command
        prompt / powershell and Ubuntu.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speaking of Ubuntu, let's go ahead and
        <a href="LASDjlkjlk" target="_blank">install that next</a>. This will
        have all the usual commands and shortcuts that you're used to. Whenever
        you want to make a new Rails app or start your server, you'll use
        Ubuntu. When you install it, you'll make a username and password - they
        can be unique if you want them to, but make the password something
        you'll remember. You'll use that whenever you use the `sudo` command.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>
          FROM HERE ON IN, USE UBUNTU ONLY FOR THIS INSTALLATION.
        </strong>
        Think of this like you're using a simulation of a mac inside Ubuntu.
        You'll need to configure Git in here as if you didn't in your
        Powershell.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you're on Ubuntu, the root folder is different when you're on a PC
        - there is no 'root' folder for PC. So when you want to navigate to
        other folders in your computer, you'll have to go to /mnt/c -> which is
        really the root of your C drive.
      </p>

      <p>
        So the next step is to start on the Rails installation. You can follow
        along there or just stick to this page.
      </p>
      <p>This will install some dependencies that you'll need for Ruby</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          sudo apt-get update <br />
          sudo apt-get install git-core curl zlib1g-dev build-essential
          libssl-dev li/peadline-dev libyaml-dev libsqlite3-dev sqlite3
          libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev
          software-properties-common libffi-dev
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>Now we'll install Ruby with Rbenv with the following commands</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          cd git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git ~/.rbenv <br />
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc <br />
          echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc <br />
          exec $SHELL git clone
          <br />
          <br />
          https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git ~/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
          echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/plugins/ruby-build/bin:$PATH"' >>
          ~/.bashrc exec $SHELL
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        Then to get the specific Ruby version we want, we use the following
        commands utilizing Rbenv to get 3.03
      </p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          rbenv install 3.0.3 <br />
          rbenv global 3.0.3
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>Confirm you've got Ruby installed..</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code> ruby -v </code>
      </div>

      <p>Then install the Bundler gem</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          gem install bundler <br />
          rbenv rehash
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>Next we'll install Git (change the red text to your login info)</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          git config --global color.ui true <br />
          git config --global user.name
          <span style="color: red">"YOUR NAME"</span><br />
          git config --global user.email
          <span style="color: red">"YOUR@EMAIL.com" </span><br />
          ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C
          <span style="color: red">"YOUR@EMAIL.com"</span>
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>
        In the Gorails tutorial, it has us set up an SSH key for Github - but
        that's been depreciated from what I understand. Github now uses Personal
        Access Tokens - you can find this setup in your Github settings >
        Developer Settings > Personal access tokens. Following the Github setup
        shouldn't spark any issues.
      </p>

      <p>
        Next we'll get Node and Yarn. These are more dependencies for Rails, and
        hey you might use them in the future.
      </p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash - <br />
          curl -sS https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/pubkey.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
          <br />
          echo "deb https://dl.yarnpkg.com/debian/ stable main" | sudo tee
          /etc/apt/sources.list.d/yarn.list <br />
          <br />

          sudo apt update <br />
          sudo apt-get install -y nodejs yarn
        </code>
      </div>

      <p>Finally we install Rails!</p>

      <div class="codebox rounded">
        <code>
          gem install rails -v 7.0.0.rc1 <br />
          rbenv reshash
        </code>
      </div>
      <p>
        Now the Gorails tutorial suggests that you make all of your projects in
        the /mnt/c/*** files. Again when you're on Ubuntu, the root folder is
        different when you're on a PC - there is no 'root' folder for PC. So
        when you want to navigate to other folders in your computer, you'll have
        to go to /mnt/c -> which is really the root of your C drive.
        <br />
        Personally, I've found that rails commands take FOREVER when you're
        going through /mnt/c/etc. I've moved all my projects to the 'root'
        folder in Ubuntu and haven't had any problems.
      </p>

        src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1220/0*jbEo9j6l_9Q9y3tB.jpg"
        alt=""
      />

      <div id="postgres">
        <p>
          Now we'll install Postgresql. Here's where the Gorails tutorial stops
          being helpful, as it asks us to install it through the Microsoft
          Store. This just led me to huge headaches & I ended up having to
          uninstall EVERYTHING and start again. Thankfully I found an amazing
          blog that I'll synthesize here.
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code> sudo apt-get install postgresql </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Next we'll need to set up a password for postgres, you can make it the
          same as any of your other passwords if that makes it easier. Basically
          you can set up different users that have different database
          permissions.
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code> sudo passwd postgres </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Now we'll need to edit the postgres.conf file. This is hidden deep in
          your computer, and you can either edit it like the guide suggests with
          the following command (the version might be different to what you
          installed):
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code>
            sudo vi /etc/postgresql/<span style="color: red">10</span
            >/main/postgresql.conf
          </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Personally instead of learning how to edit it that way, I simply used
          the
          <a href="https://www.voidtools.com/" target="_blank">Everything</a>
          program to search for that file, and edit in in VSCode. I found it in:
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code>
            C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\etc\postgresql\12\main\postgresql.conf
          </code>
        </div>
        <p>
          Once you're inside - you'll want to edit one part that's commented
          out. Uncomment and edit it so that:
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code> data_sync_retry = true. </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          Up next is the most important command you'll need!! This starts the
          PostgreSQL service on your machine, so Rails can finally create
          databases.
        </p>
        <div class="codebox rounded">
          <code> sudo /etc/init.d/postgresql start </code>
        </div>

        <p>
          You'll want to save that command - whenever you restart your PC, it
          won't start that process immediately. So you can run it whenever you
          boot up and want to start some Rails projects, or
          <a href="https://github.com/troytse/wsl-autostart" target="_blank">
            make a simple script for yourself that runs it on bootup.
          </a>
        </p>
      </div>

      <div id="bugs">
        <p>
          If you're having issues with other Rails projects that you've worked
          on and are now cloning on your PC, check out

            >this Stackoverflow post</a
          >. You'll have to go back into that postgresql.conf file again and
          change the port that you're using, or change the listen addresses.
        </p>
      </div>
